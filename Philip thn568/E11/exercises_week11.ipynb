    "While researchers have been modeling the spread of diseases and information for many years, the COVID-19 pandemic playing out right now puts a new emphasis on the importance of being able to model (and thus predict) how diseases propagate through populations. So how do you most effectively model the spread of a disease? There are many^ ways, and all of them (at least the useful ones) involves networks. In this notebook you will get your hands on a couple different modeling approaches. Specifically:\n",

    "In a *contact network* nodes are people and links represent interactions that can happen between people. You can use such a network as a *substrate* for simulating the spreading of \"something\". Spreading of what? That's up to you. It can be a disease, a behavior, a piece of information, anything you can imagine people may pass along. There's a whole subfield of Network Science which deals with this, but the fundamental idea is actually quite simple:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Nodes that are connected can transmit this \"something\" with a probability. Each timestep of the simulation is an opportunity for the \"something\" to spread.\n",

    "You can then make this more nuanced by adding extra criteria for transmission. For disease modeling these can e.g. be that nodes can only be infected after multiple exposures or if multiple neighbors are infected, that they can be cured and become resistant/susceptible with some probability, that they may die and exit the simulation creating a void in the network, that becoming infected makes them change their links, that godzilla walks in and eats everyone—the possibilities are endless and you decide which rules exist in the simulation universe."

    "* *Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS)*: Nodes are susceptible, then get infected and stay infected for some time, then get susceptible again, an the cycle continues. This could model things like the flu which comes and goes and you get and recover from over and over again.\n",
    "* *Susceptible-Infected-Resistant (SIR)*: Nodes become infected and after some time they gain resistance so that they can niether become infected nor spread disease/information further. Once they are resistant they are essentially \"removed\" from the network, so this type of model works for diseases where people recover and gain resistance as well as ones that kill people, as niether type of person can transmit (measles, chickenpox but also rabies, Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, etc.).\n",

Components are then coupled because there are people moving between them. The paper *The Hidden Geometry of Complex,\n",

It is a must read if you\n",
